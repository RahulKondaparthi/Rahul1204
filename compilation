File---->Filenmae.c----->Filename.i---------->Filename.s-------------->Filename.o

Pre-processing:

            Removal of Comments
            Expansion of Macros
            Expansion of the included files.
            Conditional compilation
            
The preprocessed output is stored in the filename.i

Compilation:

The next step is to compile filename.i and produce an; intermediate compiled output file filename.s. 
This file is in assembly level instructions. 

Assembler:

In this phase the filename.s is taken as input and turned into filename.o by assembler.
This file contain machine level instructions.

Linking

This is the final phase in which all the linking of function calls with their definitions are done. 
Linker knows where all these functions are implemented.
Linker does some extra work also, it adds some extra code to our program which is required when the program starts and ends.
