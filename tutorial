2) How to debug a core in C/C++?
 A process dumps core when it is terminated by operating system due to fault in program.
 The most common fault is that program accessing invalid pointer(NNULL) or value out area of memory..It is useful for debugging.
 The core is dumped to the /proc/sys/kernel directory by default. To debug a core, the program must be compiled with the -g option. 
 
3)Segmentation fault ?
  A segmentation fault occurs when a program aacees to memory(beyond the limits) that is not allowed by operating system.
         Accessing an array out of bounds.(indexed array where the index is outside of the array bounds)
         Dereferencing NULL pointers
         Dereferencing freed memory
         Dereferencing uninitialized pointers
         Incorrect use of the "&" (address of) and "*" (dereferencing) operators
         Improper formatting specifiers in printf and scanf statements
         Stack overflow
