There are many ways to get a segfault, at least in the lower-level languages such as C(++). A common way to get a segfault is to dereference a null pointer:

int *p = NULL;
*p = 1;



Another segfault happens when you try to write to a portion of memory that was marked as read-only:

char *str = "Foo"; // Compiler marks the constant string as read-only
*str = 'b'; // Which means this is illegal and results in a segfault




Dangling pointer points to a thing that does not exist any more, like here:

char *p = NULL;
{
    char c;
    p = &c;
}
// Now p is dangling
The pointer p dangles because it points to character variable c that ceased to exist after the block ended. 
And when you try to dereference dangling pointer (like *p='A'), you would probably get a segfault.
